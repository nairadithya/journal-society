## What Is The Journal Society
The Journal Society is a group of people coming together on a regular basis to discuss scientific and mathematical ideas in a rigorous manner. The document you are reading currently is a loose transcription of those discussions as well as the efforts undertaken by those members to solve the problems posed by those discussions.

## Real Analysis
The notes on Real Analysis is taken from discussions around the textbook **Analysis I** by **Terence Tao**. We intend to continue the discussions until the section on Real Numbers, as it forms a common foundation of knowledge and provides a systematic approach to discussing the other topics that the discussions might move towards.

## Motivation
The sessions will soon branch out into other fields of inquiry, including but not limited to astrophysics, harmonic analysis, theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. The larger goal of this society is to instill a sense of mathematical and scientific inquiry in its members as well as setting a good example for our peers and people who are interested in such forms of inquiry.

## Contact Us
The problems for most of the sessions have been left open to encourage finding the solutions, if you are stuck with any of the problems, email me at bl.en.u4aid23002@bl.students.amrita.edu or Vennela at bl.en.u4aid23053@bl.students.amrita.edu

## Usage

This repository will act as a single point of entry for all things to do with the Journal Society. Session notes written in LaTeX will be stored as .tex files and .pdf in the `notes/` folder and all documents sent in and used for reference will be in `reference/`

## For Members

If any errors are found in the notes or any files are missing, submit an issue or a pull request with the required changes.
